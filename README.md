## Description

Bubble is a social media platform emphasizing minimalist functionality and expression.

- We looked at other social media platforms, and in response to the overcomplication, we designed a "5-minute", back-to-the-basics application that people will enjoy using. 
- We built this project to practice designing a site we would actually want to use, using a modern social media-friendly MERN stack including React, GraphQL, and MongoDB. 
- This application gives users the experience of a basic social media site without all the bells and whistles that crowd the screen on modern social media applications. It allows the user to have fun creating a compact, expressive profile to showcase their mood with a short "bio" message, and join the conversation with friends through posts and replies. 
- We learned many of the ins-and-outs of modern social media development from the planning and concept phase, to using a MERN stack and GraphQL, and the many intricacies and trials of putting it all together and debugging various scenarios to create a robust deployed application. 


## Installation

This application runs in a web browser through its deployment on Netlify (front end) and Heroku (back end) services. It is accessed via https://bubblesocial.netlify.app/

## Usage

The user can create an account on the login/create account page. Next, the user can edit the name, color, avatar, and bio of their profile.
